I need you to:
1. Inside input/text folder take script file and text to speech it.
2. Generate captions by transcribing generated voiceover.
3. Inside input/videos folder take all videos from body, hook and packshot folders. Assemble them in order: hook, body, packshot
4. Add the voicover to results
5. Overlap resulted videos with captions.
6. Add music tracks to results, but decrease loudness not to interrupt the voiceover.
7. Resize all resulted videos
