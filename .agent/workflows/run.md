I need you to:
1. Inside input/text folder take script file and text to speech it. Paste resulted voiceover to input/voiceover folder.
2. Generate dubbings for Polish, Ukrainian and Spanish.
3. Generate captions by transcribing generated voiceovers of different languages. Ensure captions aren't blank for all languages.
4. Inside input/videos folder take all videos from body, hook and packshot folders. Assemble them in order: hook, body, packshot
5. Add the voicovers to results
6. Overlap resulted videos with captions.
7. Add music tracks to results, but decrease loudness not to interrupt the voiceover.
8. Resize all resulted videos
